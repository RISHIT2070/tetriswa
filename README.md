üöÄ Exciting News: Just Completed a GitOps Project with Argo CD and Argo Rollouts on AWS EKS! (Game Deployment)

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed a hands-on project focused on implementing GitOps practices using Argo CD and Argo Rollouts within an AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) environment. Here's a brief overview of what I accomplished:

üîß **Project Overview**: The project aimed to automate the deployment and management of a simple web application using GitOps principles on AWS EKS.

üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**:
- AWS EKS: Leveraged AWS EKS, a fully managed Kubernetes service, for container orchestration.
- Argo CD: Implemented continuous deployment using Argo CD, a GitOps continuous delivery tool.
- Argo Rollouts: Utilized Argo Rollouts for advanced deployment strategies, including canary releases.

üìù **Tasks Completed**:
1. **Setup and Configuration**: Created a GitHub repository and installed Argo CD and Argo Rollouts on the AWS EKS cluster.
2. **GitOps Pipeline**: Dockerized the web application, deployed it using Argo CD, and configured automatic deployment upon code changes.
3. **Canary Release**: Implemented a canary release strategy with Argo Rollouts, ensuring smooth and controlled deployments of new application versions.
4. **Documentation and Cleanup**: Documented the entire process, including setup, deployment steps, and cleanup instructions to maintain a clean environment on AWS EKS.

üì¶ **Deliverables**:
- GitHub Repository: [Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RISHIT2070/tetriswa)
- Detailed Documentation: [README.md in GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RISHIT2070/tetriswa/blob/main/README.md)

üåü **Key Takeaways**:
- Enhanced understanding of GitOps practices and their application in real-world scenarios, particularly on AWS EKS.
- Hands-on experience with AWS EKS, Argo CD, and Argo Rollouts for continuous deployment and advanced deployment strategies.

I'm proud of the progress made and excited to continue exploring and mastering DevOps practices on AWS EKS. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey!
